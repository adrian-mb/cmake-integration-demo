# cmake-integration-demo
Basic skeleton of a C++ project integrated using CMake and GitHub submodules.

Run ./build.sh on the appserver directory to build project and submodules.
Remember to initialize submodules with `git submodule init` if not done by default.

To generate project files for Eclipse, run ./generate-eclipse-project.sh on the root directory.
Project files will be generated on the eclipse-project directory; import these files into Eclipse as a project.
